                    Safety Tips. This advice is general in nature and does not replace legal, medical, or
                    professional guidance. Users should seek appropriate professional guidance in their own
                    location as needed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a strong password, keep your account login details private, and log out after each session.</li>
                        <li><b>Never send money to another person under any circumstances!</b> If another person asks you for money or valuables, please Report it by using the "Report" button.</li>
                        <li>Never share details of your financial accounts or financial matters.</li>
                        <li>Read our Scam Awareness Information below and be cautious of people who claim they are unable to video chat.</li>
                        <li>Keep communication on ÜLO rather than switching to phone, email, or other messaging apps, especially before you have met the other person.</li>
                        <li>Do not share private personal details such as your email address, your home or workplace address, your bank details, your government-issued identification numbers, your date of birth, your daily activities, or information about your family members, colleagues, or friends. If you are a single parent, we recommend you do not disclose this until after you have met in person and determined it is safe to do so.</li>
                        <li>Please Report behaviour that violates our Terms and Conditions, Community Rules, or is suspicious. This includes:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Nudity;</li>
                            <li>Abusive language, threats, harassment or harmful behaviour;</li>
                            <li>Obscene, sexual, or offensive material;</li>
                            <li>People you suspect are under eighteen (18) years of age;</li>
                            <li>Any requests for money;</li>
                            <li>Fake profiles; and</li>
                            <li>Spam material.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Be cautious of people pretending to be ÜLO staff or customer support. ÜLO will never email or contact you asking you to verify your personal details, email address, ÜLO password, bank account details, or for payment of any kind. If this occurs, please contact us directly through our Website or application. If you receive any communication and you are unsure if it is legitimately from us, do not reply and contact us directly through our Website or application. Do not click on any links in emails you are unsure of, even if they appear to be official.</li>
                        <li><b>Tips for meeting new people in person:</b> Get to know each other before meeting in person. Engage in video conversations, ask questions, and use your judgement to determine if this is a safe person to meet. When you meet a new person make a safety plan by telling a friend or family member you are meeting a new person from online, tell them the person's name and basic information, and let this friend or family member know the time and location of this meeting. Show this friend or family member photos of the person you are meeting. Let this friend or family member know you are safe during and after the meeting (for example by text message). Meet in an open and safe public location with security cameras such as a café (not a private residence or location - at least until you have met the person a few times). Do not agree to travel to a private location on your first meeting. Take your charged mobile phone and/or smartwatch with you. Do not enter a motor vehicle with the person until you have met them several times. Meet in a location that is easily accessible by public transport, or arrange your own transportation, so you can leave the meeting anytime you wish (do not be dependent on the person you are meeting for transportation). Be careful with your personal belongings particularly if you are meeting more than one person. We recommend you avoid drinking alcohol or using any substances when meeting new people. Do not accept any food or drinks directly from the person you are meeting (it’s always better to be safe than sorry) and do not leave food or drinks unattended. Be aware that most drugs used for food and drink spiking are undetectable (they are typically tasteless, colourless, and have no smell). Remember it is entirely your choice when you leave a meeting – if you aren’t enjoying a meeting, simply politely leave. If you have a serious negative experience Report the incident on our platform and contact your local police or emergency services if appropriate.</li>
                        <li>Talk about consent before sexual activity, know consent is needed before sexual activity, know it's okay to discuss consent during sexual activity, and know it’s your choice to say “No” to anything you do not want to do at any time. Further information about sexual consent from the Australian government may be found at <a href="https://www.consent.gov.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.consent.gov.au</a>. Be aware of the relevant laws in your location.</li>
                        <li>We encourage you to practice safe sex and talk to your doctor and potential partners about sexual health checks and the risks of Sexually Transmitted Infections.</li>
                        <li>Be aware that laws regarding LGBTQ+ relationships vary widely by country. In some locations, using dating or social apps may carry legal risks. We recommend exercising caution and being familiar with local laws when communicating or meeting with others. ILGA World (<a href="https://ilga.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ilga.org</a>) is one source that may have up-to-date information on international sexual orientation laws.</li>
                        <li>Please report cybercrimes to the relevant authorities in your location. If you are in Australia, cybercrimes and online incidents can be reported to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, Scamwatch, and to the police via Policelink. If you are in the USA, cybercrimes can be reported to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Centre (<a href="https://www.ic3.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ic3.gov</a>).</li>
                        <li>If you need support or are suffering from poor mental health, please seek help from relevant medical professionals and organisations in your location (for example, if you are in Australia, you can see your doctor, visit your local hospital emergency department, and contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636).</li>
                        <li>If you are in an emergency or feeling suicidal, please phone your local police or emergency services (for example, if you are in Australia phone 000, or if you are in the USA or Canada, call 911) or attend your local hospital.</li>
                      </ul>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <p class="section-content">Scams can be reported by clicking the “Report” button. Alternatively, if you can’t access your

                <h5>1. KEY INFORMATION ON SCAMMING</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li style="color: red;;"><u>NEVER</u> SEND MONEY OR VALUABLES TO ANYONE YOU HAVE ONLY
                        EVER MET ONLINE IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!</li>
                    <li>If someone asks you to transfer money to them via a wire service, money order, bank
                        transfer, pre-loaded cards or electronic currencies (for example bitcoin), etc. do not do
                        it, and Report it. After you have sent money it is typically very difficult or impossible
                        to retrieve it.</li>
                    <li>Have you met someone recently and they’ve already professed their love? Be careful -
                        it could be a scam.</li>
                    <li>If someone you met online says they need your help or your money, it’s probably a
                        scam.</li>
                    <li>If someone asks you for money, don’t reply no matter what their reason is.</li>
                    <li>Don't share your banking or credit card details with anyone you have only met online.</li>
                    <li>Some scammers may ask for a loan or to co-invest in a business venture; typically, with a too-good to-be-true return on investment. Any 'investment' in these scams will equate to a loss.</li>
                    <li>If you are asked to cash or deposit a cheque for someone you have only met online,
                        don’t do it. Scammers will ask you to send them money before the cheque clears but
                        the cheques are always bad. NEVER commit to any bank or monetary transaction for
                        someone you have only met online.</li>
                    <li>If someone asks to move your communications outside the site after only a few contacts, be careful - scammers often ask for this.</li>
                    <li>Anyone can fall for a scam - be careful and report any suspicious conduct.</li>
                    <li>Met someone who sounds too good to be true? Be careful - it could be a scam.</li>
                    <li>Do an image search of your admirer to help determine if they really are who they say they are. You can use image search services such as Google or TinEye.</li>
                    <li>Beware of accepting gifts that could be used to conceal drugs. Some scam victims have been caught carrying drugs through customs in luggage they were given as a present.</li>
                    <li>Do not agree to transfer money or send valuable items for someone else. Money laundering and drug trafficking are criminal offences.</li>
                    <li>Contact from a person overseas may increase the chance they are a scammer, even if they say they are just travelling for work.</li>
                    <li>Never share intimate photos or videos with prospective partners, especially if you've never met them. Scammers are known to blackmail their targets using compromising material.</li>
                    <li>Be aware that scammers may use artificial intelligence (AI) to create fake images,
                        voices, or videos that look real.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">A. Short examples of scammer conduct</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scammers will often tell you they need money for medical treatment, be it for themselves, a sick relative or child.</li>
                    <li>Scammers sometimes take a long time to build a relationship with you - never send money to anyone you meet online, no matter how long you have been chatting with them.</li>
                    <li>A common tactic for scammers is to ask for money for flights, visas or other expenses and promise that they will come and visit you - don't be fooled.</li>
                    <li>Some scammers will tell you that they are in the military and need money for a leave pass so they can visit you. This is a scam.</li>
                    <li>It is not a coincidence that the scammer's video camera never seems to work.</li>
                    <li>Scammers may claim to be recently widowed to gain your trust, sympathy and money. Sometimes scammers ask for a small amount of money and will pay it back. They may also send small gifts. These are just tactics to gain your trust.</li>
                    <li>If anyone asks you for personal details such as banking details or credit card numbers, don't send them.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="section-title">B. More detailed examples of scammer conduct</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You should exercise caution wherever someone you meet online claims that they are stationed overseas as an oil worker, aid worker, as part of a peacekeeping force, military or other job. Scammers will often use this excuse and ask you to send money because of some crisis, like being robbed or becoming sick.</li>
                    <li>Scammers will often use this excuse and ask you to send money because of some
                        crisis, like being robbed or becoming sick.</li>
                    <li>Scammers might ask you to transfer money for them through your account, telling you it is because they are unable to transfer the money themselves. You should never give out personal financial information to anyone you meet online because of the risk of identity theft. Transferring money may also involve you in money laundering, a serious crime, and expose you to criminal prosecution.</li>
                    <li>Been offered a big payout by someone you met online? Scammers will use all kinds of stories to get you to send money to them. They might tell you that the money will go to a charity or be invested in a business such as oil exploration or gold mining. Alternatively, they may promise that paying money will allow you to access a lottery prize, a long-lost inheritance or treasure, like a cache of gemstones. What are the chances that you will find both true love and millions of dollars online? Don't respond to these offers.</li>
                    <li>Be careful of sharing your personal information, such as your full name, address, birth date, family details or intimate photographs and videos with people you meet online. These may be used by scammers for the purposes of identity theft or blackmail.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="section-title">3. Advice to Scam Victims</h2>
                <ol type="A">
                    <li><b>Cease communication</b>. If you think you have been scammed, the first step is to immediately cease communication with the scammer, to avoid losing more money or giving away more personal information. Ignore any attempts by the scammer to communicate with you and take steps to block future communications, such as setting up rules in your email, social media accounts and on your mobile phone or even changing your mobile phone number, email address and social media accounts.</li>
                    <li><b>Contact site operator</b>. You should report the scammer to the dating site where you first had contact with them, as they may be targeting other users. Details of your report will be kept confidential. You should provide the site operator with as much information about the scammer as possible. This may include examples of emails or instant messaging communications received from the scammer and photos, names and addresses, email addresses or phone numbers used by the scammer.</li>
                    <li><b>Contact your financial institution</b>. If you have sent money to the scammer and particularly if you have provided any personal or financial details, you should contact your financial institution and inform them. If you have given the scammer information such as account numbers, credit card numbers or passwords you should immediately change them. If you used a service, such as a money transfer service or bank to send money to the scammer you should contact the service provider so that they can stop others from sending money to the scammer.</li>
                    <li><b>If in Australia report the scam to the National Anti-Scam Centre run by the
                        Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Scamwatch,
                        IDCARE, and the Police.</b> Reporting a scam to the ACCC assists with monitoring scam trends. You can report a scam to the ACCC via the online reporting form on the ACCC's Scamwatch website www.scamwatch.gov.au . The details of complaints made to the ACCC will be kept confidential. <b>Alternatively, if you are not in Australia contact your local government to identify the best department or organisation to contact.confidential. Alternatively, if you are not in Australia contact your local
government to identify the best department or organisation to contact.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Contact police If you have sent money to the scammer</b>. If you are in Australia, you should report the matter to the police via the Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN) at www.acorn.gov.au. Alternatively, if you are not in Australia contact your local police department or relevant entity. If someone attempts to blackmail you, or makes threats of any kind, you should contact the police immediately.</li>
                    <li><b>Beware of future contact</b>. Scammers will often contact you under new guises to try and get more money from you. They may pretend to be lawyers, government officials or police, often from another country, and claim that they have caught the scammer and need money to recover your losses. You should never send money—the scammers are simply trying to get more out of you.</li>
                    <li><b>Take steps to protect your personal data</b>. Scammers collect information about you during a scam and may use this information for other fraudulent activity. Take some time to review what information the scammer might have about you and take steps to change this information. Information such as passport numbers, bank account details and driver's licence numbers are particularly valuable to scammers. Consider changing your mobile phone number, email address and any social media accounts. Ensure your privacy settings are set at the highest level and your accounts are accessible to only those people you know and trust. Public access is just that. Anyone can find out very personal information about you including where you live and work; your patterns and routines; and details about your kids, hobbies and interests.</li>

                <h2 class="section-title">4. Detailed Example of Scam Progression</h2>
                <p class="section-content">Jessica, an Australian businesswoman in her 40s, met a man called Martin on an online dating site.</p>
                <p class="section-content">Martin's profile said that he was an Australian, but he was currently working for an oil company in the
                    United Arab Emirates. He said he was posted to the UAE for a brief period to oversee an oil pipeline
                    project but was due to return home soon. He was a widower with a 10-year-old daughter. Martin's
                    photo showed that he was attractive, well-dressed but not too formal. He looked friendly and about
                    the same age.</p>
                <p class="section-content">Martin's interests were not very specific but appeared similar to Jessica's, namely sports and other
                    outdoors activities. Both were after a serious relationship and looking for a warm and loving partner.</p>
                <p class="section-content">Martin told Jessica that he could not reliably access the dating site in the UAE and so they moved
                    their communications to email and phone.</p>
                <p class="section-content">Jessica and Martin struck up a close relationship and exchanged regular emails and many phone
                    calls. Martin came across as sensitive and caring and often listened to her problems. He showed an
                    interest in her life, including her business affairs. He liked to call just to tell her he missed her and
                    would love to meet up. After several months Jessica felt that she could tell Martin anything and Martin
                    confessed his love for her.</p>
                
                <p class="section-content">Soon afterwards, Jessica received an email from Martin claiming that he had been mugged and lost
                    his wallet. He said that he was working away from his camp, and at the hotel where he was staying,
                    the hotel manager was holding his passport and refused to return it until he paid his next month's bill.
                    He was soon to be paid but asked Jessica to advance him $1200 by wire transfer to help with his
                    hotel bill. Jessica thought he would pay her back, so she wired the money across.</p>

                <p class="section-content">Some weeks later, Martin called Jessica in quite a state and told her that his daughter had been
                    struck by a car in a hit and run on her way to school and suffered a brain haemorrhage. He said that
                    he needed $8000 quickly, to pay for an expensive operation to save her life. Horrified by these events,
                    Jessica sent the money via wire transfer as it would be quicker.</p>

                <p class="section-content">Things were settled for a while and then Martin told Jessica that he had an opportunity to invest in oil
                    exploration in Ghana. The enterprise was to help the poor local community and investors would be
                    well rewarded. He said that she was guaranteed a big return if she sent him $40 000 to invest. He
                    said that this would help them set up a home together when he returned to Australia soon. He also
                    advised her to transfer the money from her bank to the investment account held at Barclays bank
                    because this would be safer, and he gave her all the relevant details.</p>
                <p class="section-content">Jessica was concerned because this was a large sum of money and asked her friends and relatives
                    what she should do. Some of her friends expressed concern that she may be dealing with an online
                    scammer.</p>
                
                <p class="section-content">Jessica questioned Martin's motives. He told her he was very hurt and sent her photographs which he
                    claimed were photos of himself with his daughter and children in the local community. Jessica told her
                    friends that she knew and trusted him and decided to send the money anyway.</p>
                <p class="section-content">Over time, Jessica was asked to help in a number of ways as well as pay for fees and taxes on her
                    'investments' until she had paid over $90 000. Some of Jessica's friends showed her material about
                    online scams, so Jessica began to keep details about the relationship to herself. However, when
                    Jessica again mentioned her concerns to Martin, he told her that he "swore by almighty God" that he
                    loved her and the money she sent was being invested in their relationship.</p>
                <p class="section-content">It was hard, but soon Jessica had to admit to herself that there was something wrong. She thought
                    about how the conversations often turned to money and the requests for more were becoming very
                    frequent. One day after he had asked for more money to organise travel to Australia she decided to
                    stop. Martin's emails and phone calls became increasingly insistent and angry. She should have hung
                    up straight away, but she still felt something for him.</p>

                <p class="section-content">Then Jessica received an email threatening to send her friends and family copies of intimate photos
                    Jessica had sent to Martin, unless she paid another $10,000. This cemented in Jessica's mind that
                    the whole affair was an elaborate scam and Jessica finally sought help from the police.</p>

                <p class="section-content">Jessica felt devastated that a man she felt she could trust implicitly was in fact a scammer. In addition
                    to these mental and emotional costs, she had also sent the scammer more than $90,000—most of
                    her life savings.</p>
                <p class="section-content">She found it hard to discuss this with her family and friends because she felt so foolish. They had
                    warned her, but she trusted the scammer over those truly closest to her. When she did her own
                    research, she found that she was not alone. Many others had had similar experiences.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-title">5. Scam FAQs</h2>
                    <h2 class="section-title">A. What is a dating scam?</h2>
                <p class="section-content">On a dating site, a scammer is someone who builds a relationship with you, pretending to be a legitimate user of a dating site, and then uses fraudulent claims to defraud you. Scammers will ask you for money, personal or financial information, or try to redirect you to sites that require payment or download malicious software onto your computer. Scams of this sort can be very sophisticated, and scammers will go to great lengths to build a relationship with you, spending a lot of time communicating with you and perhaps even telling you they love you and sending you gifts. The key rule is that you should never send money to anyone you meet online and should reconsider your relationship with anyone who asks you for money or who you otherwise suspect may be a scammer. Scammers will often ask you to send money via a wire transfer service and you will usually be unable to recover money sent this way. You should also never share personal information, such as bank account or credit card details, as you risk falling victim to fraud and identity theft.</p>
                <h2 class="section-title">B. How can I spot a scammer?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>They claim to be travelling or stationed overseas, even if it is temporary or for work.</li>
                    <li>They ask you to send them money or provide your personal or financial details.</li>
                    <li>They ask you to transfer money via a wire transfer service.</li>
                    <li>They ask you to send larger amounts via a bank transfer.</li>
                    <li>They quickly profess strong feelings or love for you.</li>
                    <li>They are vague about their interests, or what they want in a partner and not particular about how old their partner might be.</li>
                    <li>Their computer camera or Skype connection never seem to work.</li>
                    <li>They do not answer your questions or their responses are formulaic, nonsensical or repetitive.</li>
                    <li>Their profile is at odds with their story, or their communications with you display poor spelling or grammar.</li>
                    <li>You should carefully consider your relationship with anyone who asks you to move communications with them away from the dating site onto email, instant messaging, the phone, VoIP or some other medium after only a few contacts. Scammers will often ask you to do this so that you will be communicating only with them, are more likely to reveal personal information and you will not receive safety warnings.</li>
                    <li>Scammers will often contact you under new guises to try and get more money from you. They may pretend to be lawyers, government officials or police, often from another country, and claim that they have caught the scammer and need money to recover your losses. You should never send money—the scammers are simply trying to get more out of you.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="section-title">C. Someone has asked me for money for airline tickets or other travel expenses - is this a scam?</h2>
                <p class="section-content">This sounds like a common scam. You should never send money to anyone you meet online. Scammers often promise to visit you, then pocket any money you send them. Don't send money for plane tickets, visas, customs fees or any other travel expenses the scammer claims to have. They may send you copies of their passport, tickets or visa to 'prove' they are coming to visit you - don't believe these stories. Scammers often have access to authentic-looking fake documents.</p>
                <h2 class="section-title">D. They claim to be in the military and say they need money for a leave pass - what should I do?</h2>
                <p class="section-content">This is another common scam, and you should never send money. Scammers claiming to be members of the military will often say they need your money to pay for a leave pass or some other expense so they can visit you. This is just an excuse to get you to pay money. The military does not charge for leave passes.</p>
