              <h2 class="section-title">WHAT PARTS OF THESE TERMS APPLY TO ME?</h2>
              <p>This agreement governs your use of the ÜLO Friendship and Dating Socials Platform
                (‘Platform’) and any other Services made available through the Platform. This Platform
                includes our Application (available on the Apple App and/or Google Play stores) and/or our
                Website(s).</p>
              <p>You (referred to in these Terms as ‘You’ or ‘User’) agree to be bound by this agreement as set
                out in this agreement, which forms a binding contractual agreement between each User and
                us, Universal Star Pty Ltd (Australian Company Number (ACN) 680 786 663) (referred to in
                these Terms as ‘Company’, ‘We’ or ‘Us’).</p>
              <p>Please note the English version of these Terms and Conditions is the official legal version. If
                you agree to these Terms and Conditions you are agreeing to the English version of these
                Terms and Conditions only. Similarly, the English versions of all our other legal and policy
                documents (including our Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy, Safety Tips &amp; Scam Awareness
                Information, User Guidelines and Community Rules) are the official legal versions and you
                are agreeing to the English versions of these documents. Translations from English into other
                languages are from Google Translate and are provided solely for convenience and general
                understanding. We take no liability for any errors in language translation from English into
                other languages in any of our legal or policy documents.</p>
              <p>We also encourage all communication with us to be in English. Communication in other
                languages may not be processed unless required by applicable law. If we are legally required
                to process languages other than English, we reserve the right to use Google Translate or a
                similar online translation tool to undertake this language translation at our discretion. You
                agree to waive your right to object to our use of Google Translate or similar online translation
                tool to the maximum extent of applicable law. You agree we are not liable for any errors in
                language translation made through our use of Google Translate or similar online translation
                tool.</p>

              <p>This agreement is divided into three parts:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Part A</b>, which sets out Terms that apply to <b>All Users</b>;</li>
                <li><b>Part B</b>, which sets out additional Terms that apply to Users who purchase Services
                  from the Company and/or goods and services from Third-party Service Providers
                  (‘Customers’); and</li>
                <li><b>Part C</b>, which applies to <b>Non-Australian Users</b>.</li>
                      </ul>
              <p>When we talk about the ‘Services’ in this agreement, we are referring to the services
                available from us (and not any third-party) through our Platform including our mobile
                application available on the Apple iOS Store and the Google Play Store, our Website(s) and
                any other associated services we offer.</p>
              <p>If you access or download our mobile application from the Apple App Store or Google Play
                Store, you agree to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement and any

                Your use of Google Maps/Google Earth is subject to the Google Maps/Google Earth
                Additional Terms of Service.</p>

                within our application and the versions of these legal and policy documents found on another
                source, such as our website www.ulo.social, then the versions found within our application
                Platform take precedence and shall control. If you would like a PDF version of our Terms and

                  TERMS AGAIN?</h2>
              <p>We may change any part of these Terms at any time, so you may find that different Terms
                apply the next time you use our Platform or when you next purchase our Services. While we
                may contact you to let you know of changes to these Terms (and will do so if required to by
                law), we recommend you regularly check these Terms for updates. The date of the most

                any changes made to these Terms you must immediately delete your ÜLO Account and stop
                using our Services <b>(please note deleting your ÜLO Account will not automatically cancel

                <ol type="a" >
                  <li>This agreement is governed by the law applying in Queensland, Australia. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Queensland and courts of appeal from them in respect of any proceedings arising out of or in connection with this agreement. Each party irrevocably waives any objection to the venue of any legal process on the basis that the process has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</li>
                  <li>If a dispute arises between the parties in connection with this agreement, a party must give notice in writing to the other party specifying reasonable details of the dispute. Within 10 business days after the date on which such written notice is received, each party to the dispute must appoint a senior employee of that party (as applicable) to promptly meet and engage in good faith discussions with the objective of resolving the dispute by agreement. Each party (user and us) agree to then enter into a sixty (60) business day negotiation period, to encourage resolution of the dispute before proceeding to the more formal arbitration dispute resolution forum outlined in Clause 22.1 (c) below.</li>
                  <li>Following on from Part A Clause 22.1(b) above, any dispute arising between the parties in connection with these Terms that cannot be resolved in the 60 business day agreement and negotiation period shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with, and subject to, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The designating and appointing authority shall be Resolution Institute. There shall be one arbitrator, the language of the arbitration shall be English, the place of the arbitration shall be Sydney, Australia. Each party to the arbitration is responsible for and must pay their proportionate share of costs of the arbitration on a per-party basis (including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator) and no party shall be responsible to pay any deposit for costs that exceeds such proportionate share. If for any reason the Resolution Institute cannot undertake the arbitration, we reserve the right to nominate and appoint another designating and appointing authority located within Australia to undertake the arbitration. If this occurs you waive any right you may have to object to our choice of designating and appointing authority to undertake such arbitration.</li>
                  <li>If for any reason the arbitration clause becomes not applicable, then each party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury as to any issue relating hereto in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to these Terms or any other matter involving the parties.</li>
                </ol>

                <b>22.2 WAIVER</b>
                <p>No party to this agreement may rely on the words or conduct of any other party as a waiver of any right unless the waiver is in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver. To the extent permitted by applicable law, including the ACL these terms provide for the exclusive resolution of disputes through individual legal action on your own behalf instead of through any class or representative action and you agree that any arbitration or lawsuit against us whatsoever shall be litigated by you individually and not as a member of any class action or as part of a class or representative action, and you expressly agree to waive any law entitling you to participate in any class action.</p>

Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Queensland and courts of appeal from them in respect of any proceedings arising out of or in connection with this agreement. Each party irrevocably waives any objection to the venue of any legal process on the basis that the process has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                      If a dispute arises between the parties in connection with this agreement, a party must give notice in writing to the other party specifying reasonable details of the dispute. Within 10 business days after the date on which such written notice is received, each party to the dispute must appoint a senior employee of that party (as applicable) to promptly meet and engage in good faith discussions with the objective of resolving the dispute by agreement. Each party (user and us) agree to then enter into a sixty (60) business day negotiation period, to encourage resolution of the dispute before proceeding to the more formal arbitration dispute resolution forum outlined in Clause 22.1 (c) below.

The designating and appointing authority shall be Resolution Institute. There shall be one arbitrator, the language of the arbitration shall be English, the place of the arbitration shall be Sydney, Australia. Each party to the arbitration is responsible for and must pay their proportionate share of costs of the arbitration on a per-party basis (including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator) and no party shall be responsible to pay any deposit for costs that exceeds such proportionate share. If for any reason the Resolution Institute cannot undertake the arbitration, we reserve the right to choose and appoint another designating and appointing authority located within Australia to undertake the arbitration. If this occurs you waive any right you may have to object to our choice of designating and appointing authority to undertake such arbitration.

                          <li>For any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Company agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, <b>'Representative PAGA Waiver'</b>). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the arbitration section or the associated rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; Severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on any arbitration provisions or the requirement that any remaining claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the arbitration provisions; and any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Disputes to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Disputes, the parties agree that litigation on those claims shall be stayed.</li>

                          In no event shall Company, our officers, directors, employees, or agents, be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, and whether or not we are advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. In jurisdictions that allow a limitation on liability, you agree that our liability is no more than the amount paid by you on the platform in the three (3) months preceding the date of the event giving rise to the relevant liability. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Company and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
